                <h2>The Horsehead Nebula </h2>
                <p>The Horsehead Nebula (also known as Barnard 33) is a small dark nebula in the constellation Orion.
                    The nebula is located just to the south of Alnitak, the easternmost star of Orion's Belt,
                    and is part of the much larger Orion Molecular Cloud Complex. It appears within the southern region
                    of the dense dust cloud known as Lynds 1630,
                    along the edge of the much larger, active star-forming H II region called IC 434.
                    The Horsehead Nebula is approximately 422 parsecs or 1375 light years from Earth.
                    It is one of the most identifiable nebulae because of its resemblance to a horse's head.</p>

                <h2>Rosette Nebula</h2>
                <p>The Rosette Nebula (also known as Caldwell 49) is an H II region located near one end of a giant
                    molecular cloud in the Monoceros region of the Milky Way Galaxy.
                    The open cluster NGC 2244 (Caldwell 50) is closely associated with the nebulosity, the stars of the
                    cluster having been formed from the nebula's matter.</p>
